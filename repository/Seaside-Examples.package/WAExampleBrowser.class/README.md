I browse all the examples available in the system ie all the results of class methods beginning with #exampleComponent... 

point your browser to localhost:xxx/examples/examplebrowser

If you want to see these examples

/config app:
- add a new application named "examples"
- choose WAExampleBrowser as the root component
